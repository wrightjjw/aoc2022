#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2022
[[https://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code 2022]]

I've been learning more about Emacs,
and I've decided to do AOC 2022 using Elisp to help me learn how to extend it.

** Day 1
- [[file:day01/countNumbers.el][Day 1 Code]]
Day 1 took about two days to actually complete!
It was rough, since I'm not used to the functional paradigm at all,
but I was able to get the hang of it after some serious thinking through of the problems.
Part 2 of the challenge progressed much more quickly after having had written a full Elisp program.
